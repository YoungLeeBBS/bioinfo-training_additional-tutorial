bash: **How to set up multiple jobs as a pipeline**

### 1. Creating a script

You may like to create one directory like to hold your scripts

`mkdir ~/scripts`, and to put this path to `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`

In order to ensure that no confusion can rise, bash script names often end in "**.sh**".

create one example bash scripts

`vi ~/scripts/myBash1.sh`

## !/bin/bash

clear echo "This is information provided by mysystem.sh. Program starts now."

echo "Hello, $USER"

echo "Today's date is `date`, this is week `date +"%V"`." echo "This is `uname -s` running on a `uname -m` processor."

echo "This is the uptime information:" uptime

echo "I'm creating two variables" USERS=`uptime | cut -d "," -f 3` VALUE="4" echo "There are$USERS have used this computer." echo "This is the number: $VALUE"

\(Tips: if you use vim, you may like to activate syntax highlighting, type "**:syntax enable**" in vim, you can add this setting to your `.vimrc` file to make it permanent.\)

### 2. Running a script

The script should have execute permissions for the correct owners in order to be runnable.

`chmod u+x ~/scripts/myBash1.sh`

type `~/scripts/myBash1.sh`, `bash ~/scripts/myBash1.sh` or `bash -x ~/scripts/myBash1.sh` to run the script.

```text
> ~/scripts/myBash1.sh
This is information provided by mysystem.sh. Program starts now.

Hello, liyang

Today's date is Wed Mar 21 22:07:26 CST 2018, this is week 12.
This is Darwin running on a x86_64 processor.

This is the uptime information:
22:07 up 30 days, 12:42, 14 users, load averages: 1.41 1.67 1.74

I'm creating two variables
There are 14 users have used this computer.
This is the number: 4
```

### 3. Bash basics

#### 3.1 Variables \(page 299\)

To set a variable in the shell, use

`VARNAME="value"`

Setting and exporting is usually done in one step:

`export VARNAME="value"`

#### 3.2 Quoting characters \(page 327\)

* **Escape characters: **

```text
echo $date
echo \$date
```

* **Single quotes:**

```bash
echo '$date'
```

* **Double quotes:**

```text
echo "$date"
echo "date"
echo "I said: \"Hello World!\""
```

#### 3.3 Shell expansion \(page 325\)

* **Brace expansion {}:**

```text
echo sp{el,il,al}l
```

* **Variable expansion $:**

```text
echo $SHELL
echo ${FRANKY:=Franky}
```

* **Command substitution: **

echo $\(date\) echo `date` echo date

* **Arithmetic expansion:**

```text
echo $((365*24))
echo $[365*24]
```

#### 3.4 Regular expressions \(page 346\)

| Operator | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| . | Matches any single character. |
| ? | The preceding item is optional and will be matched, at most, once. |
| \* | The preceding item will be matched zero or more times. |
| + | The preceding item will be matched one or more times. |
| {N} | The preceding item is matched exactly N times. |
| {N,} | The preceding item is matched N or more times. |
| {N,M} | The preceding item is matched at least N times, but not more than M times. |
| - | represents the range if it's not first or last in a list or the ending point of a range in a list. |
| ^ | Matches the empty string at the beginning of a line; also represents the characters not in the range of a list. |
| $ | Matches the empty string at the end of a line. |
| \b | Matches the empty string at the edge of a word. |
| \B | Matches the empty string provided it's not at the edge of a word. |
| \&lt; | Match the empty string at the beginning of word. |
| \&gt; | Match the empty string at the end of word. |

#### 3.5 grep, awk, sed, pipe\(\|\), cut, sort, uniq, join, cat, paste \(Week 1\)

#### 3.6 Conditional statements \(page 379\)

* **general:**

| Primary | Meaning |

| \[FILE1 -nt FILE2\] | True if FILE1 has been changed more recently than FILE2, or if FILE1 exists and FILE2 does not. |
| \[FILE1 -ot FILE2\] | True if FILE1 is older than FILE2, or is FILE2 exists and FILE1 does not. |
| \[FILE1 -ef FILE2\] | True if FILE1 and FILE2 refer to the same device and inode numbers. |

* **for loop:**

`for NAME [in LIST ]; do COMMANDS; done`

* **while loop:**

`while CONTROL-COMMAND; do CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS; done`

* **until loop:**

`until TEST-COMMAND; do CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS; done`

* **break **and **continue**

#### 3.7 Functions

`FUNCTION () { COMMANDS; }`

### 4. Example

Assuming that you have 5 sequencing data, you are trying to check the mapping quality for each sample based on the output log. The output log is looks like:

```text
> ll
drwxr-xr-x@ 7 liyang staff 238 Mar 22 01:08 01.input
drwxr-xr-x@ 3 liyang staff 102 Mar 22 01:24 02.output
-rw-r--r-- 1 liyang staff 145 Mar 22 01:27 README
drwxr-xr-x 3 liyang staff 102 Mar 22 01:26 bin

> cd 01.input
> ls
sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5

> cd sample1

> cat Log.final.out
Started job on | Dec 22 13:14:21
Started mapping on | Dec 22 14:10:01
Finished on | Dec 22 14:49:53
Mapping speed, Million of reads per hour | 29.16

Number of input reads | 19372132
Average input read length | 51
UNIQUE READS:
Uniquely mapped reads number | 17395896
Uniquely mapped reads % | 89.80%
Average mapped length | 50.93
Number of splices: Total | 5038
Number of splices: Annotated (sjdb) | 0
Number of splices: GT/AG | 3677
Number of splices: GC/AG | 158
Number of splices: AT/AC | 8
Number of splices: Non-canonical | 1195
Mismatch rate per base, % | 0.25%
Deletion rate per base | 0.00%
Deletion average length | 1.48
Insertion rate per base | 0.00%
Insertion average length | 1.36
MULTI-MAPPING READS:
Number of reads mapped to multiple loci | 1080034
% of reads mapped to multiple loci | 5.58%
Number of reads mapped to too many loci | 189582
% of reads mapped to too many loci | 0.98%
UNMAPPED READS:
% of reads unmapped: too many mismatches | 0.00%
% of reads unmapped: too short | 2.54%
% of reads unmapped: other | 1.10%
```

Based on these information, you need to write one bash script to extract the _**number of input reads**_, _**uniquely mapped reads number**_ and _**multi-mapped reads number**,_ and generate one summary file. Usually, the_** uniquely mapped ratio**_ were used to measure the mapping quality. The sample do not pass the criteria should be labeled.

## !/usr/bin/bash

set -o nounset set -o errexit

## echo "$OPTIND start at $OPTIND"

while getopts ":i:o:n:p:" optname; do case $optname in i\) input="$OPTARG";; o\) outputDir="$OPTARG";; n\) cutoff="$OPTARG";; p\) prefix="$OPTARG";; ?\) echo "Usage: `basename $0` -i input -o outputDir -n cutoff -p prefix";; :\) echo "No argument value for option $OPTARG";; esac

## echo "$OPTIND is now $OPTIND"

## echo $

done;

## Initialize variables

if \[ $\# -eq 8 \]; then outputDir="${outputDir%\*/}" echo "The input file is "`basename ${input}` echo "The output directory in "${outputDir} echo "The cutoff is "${cutoff} echo "the prefix for output file is "${prefix}

## get values from input file

totalN=`cat ${input} | grep 'Number of input reads' | cut -f 2` uniqN=`cat ${input} | grep 'Uniquely mapped reads number' | cut -f 2` ratio=`bc <<< "scale=4; $uniqN/$totalN"` multiN=`cat ${input} | grep 'Number of reads mapped to multiple loci' | cut -f 2`

if \(\( $\(echo "$ratio &gt; $cutoff" \| bc -l\) \)\); then echo "The mapping result is pass the cutoff" echo -e "${totalN}\t${uniqN}\t${multiN}" \| awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}{print $1,$2,$3,$2/$1,$2+$3,\($2+$3\)/$1,"pass"}' &gt;&gt; $outputDir/$prefix.sta else echo "The mapping result is NOT pass the cutoff" echo -e "${totalN}\t${uniqN}\t${multiN}" \| awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}{print $1,$2,$3,$2/$1,$2+$3,\($2+$3\)/$1,"fail"}' &gt;&gt; $outputDir/$prefix.sta fi

echo "Job finished!" fi

Run the script:

``for i in `ls 01.input/`;``

`do echo $i;`

`bash bin/sta.sh -i 01.input/$i/Log.final.out -o 02.output/ -n 0.9 -p summary;`

`done`

> cat md5sum.txt
MD5 (./file1) = 15e8d15469ba992caac192b8684396a3
MD5 (./file2) = 85dc26fde0917b4dbba6339607b63d31

MD5 (./file4) = d09c83de50bb2da6c0c824fe44ba887a
MD5 (./file5) = db648585dd242f899818247643e599dd
```
