# 4. QC and normalization

## Input datasets

load R libraries

```r
library(SingleCellExperiment)
library(scater)
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

load the expression matrix and sample annotations

```r
mx <- read.table("GSE71008/GSE71008.NvsCRC.reads.txt", sep = "\t")
anno <- read.table("GSE71008/GSE71008.NvsCRC.anno.txt", sep = "\t", header=T)
```

Inspect a small portion of the expression matrix and sample annotations

```r
head(mx[,1:5])
```

```text
               s1S1 s1S2 s1S3 s2S1 s2S2
A-NT2RP7011570   11   10    6    0    9
C-ADG04260        1    1    1    1    1
C-ADG07684        2    3    5    3    5
C-ASTRO3000154    9    9   10    5   11
C-BRACE2001543    0    0    0    0    0
C-BRACE2001954    1    2    1    1    1
```

```r
head(anno)
```

```text
         CancerType Stage Individual Class
1 Colorectal_Cancer    1S       s1S1    S1
2 Colorectal_Cancer    1S       s1S2    S1
3 Colorectal_Cancer    1S       s1S3    S1
4 Colorectal_Cancer    1S       s1S4    S1
5 Colorectal_Cancer    1S       s1S5    S1
6 Colorectal_Cancer    1S       s1S9    S1
```

We create SCE object to standardize the analysis using both `SingleCellExperiment` \(SCE\) and `scater` packages.

```r
anno_NvsSeach <- anno
mx_NvsSeach <- mx
reads_NvsSeach <- SingleCellExperiment(
    assays = list(counts = as.matrix(mx_NvsSeach)),
    colData = anno_NvsSeach)
```

Remove genes that are not expressed in any samples

```r
keep_feature <- rowSums(counts(reads_NvsSeach) > 0) > 0
reads_NvsSeach <- reads_NvsSeach[keep_feature, ]
```

## 4.1 Sample QC

Considering the heterogeneities and batch effect between samples, we need to filter out untreated samples and genes.
